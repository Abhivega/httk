About the High-Throughput Toolkit
---------------------------------

The High-Throughput Toolkit (*httk*) is a toolkit for:

- Preparing and running calculations.
- Analyzing the results.
- Store the results and outcome in a global and/or in a personalized database.

*httk* is an independent implementation of the database-centric high-throughput methodology
pioneered by Ceder et al., and others. [see, e.g., Comp. Mat. Sci. 50, 2295 (2011)].
*httk* is presently targeted at atomistic calculations in materials science and electronic
structure, but aims to be extended into a library useful also outside those areas.

----------
Quickstart
----------

Install
*******

1. You need Python 2.7 and access to pip and git in your terminal
   window. (You can get Python and pip, e.g., by installing the Python 2.7 version
   of Anaconda, https://www.anaconda.com/download, which should give you
   all you need on Linux, macOS and Windows. You can get git from here:
   https://git-scm.com/ )

2. Issue in your terminal window::

     git clone https://github.com/rartino/httk
     cd httk
     pip install --editable . --user

   ..

     *(Skip ``--user`` for a system-wide install for all users. If you want
     to develop the httk python library inside src, instead do
     ``pip install --editable . --user``. This way edits you do under src/
     will be active immedately without having to upgrade/reinstall with pip.)*

   If you at a later point want to upgrade your installation, just go
   back to the *httk* directory and issue::

     git pull
     pip install . --upgrade --user

You are now ready to use *httk*.
     
  *(Note: an alternative to installing with ``pip install`` is to just run httk out of the
  httk directory. In that case, append ``source ~/path/to/httk/init.shell`` to your
  shell init files, with ``~/path/to/httk`` replaced by the path of your httk directory.)*

Tutorial examples
*****************

Under ``Tutorial/Step1, 2, ...`` in your *httk* directory you find a series of code snippets to run. 
You can either just execute them there, or try them out in, e.g., a Jupyter notebook.

Step 1: Load a cif file or poscar
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

This is a very simple example of just loading a structure from a ``.cif`` file and writing out some information about it.

.. code:: python
     
  import httk
  
  struct = httk.load("example.cif")
  
  print("Formula:", struct.formula)
  print("Volume:", float(struct.uc_volume))
  print("Assignments:", struct.uc_formula_symbols)
  print("Counts:", struct.uc_counts )
  print("Coords:", struct.uc_reduced_coords)

Running this generates the output::

  ('Formula:', 'BO2Tl')
  ('Volume', 509.24213999999984)
  ('Assignments',['B', 'O', 'Tl'])
  ('Counts:', [8, 16, 8])
  ('Coords', FracVector(((1350,4550,4250) , ... , ,10000)))

..
  
*(Note: the paranthesis are omitted if you use Python 3)*
     
Step 2: Creating structures in code
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

.. code:: python
	  
  from httk.atomistic import Structure
  
  cell = [[1.0, 0.0, 0.0] ,
          [0.0, 1.0, 0.0] ,
          [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]]
  coordgroups = [[
                    [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
                 ],[
                    [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
                 ],[
                    [0.5, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.5, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.5]
                 ]]
		 
  assignments = ['Pb' ,'Ti' ,'O']
  volume =62.79
  struct = Structure.create(uc_cell = cell,
               uc_reduced_coordgroups = coordgroups,
               assignments = assignments,
               uc_volume = volume)
     
     
Examples
********

In addition to the Tutorial, there is a lot of straightforward examples of various things that can be done with httk
in the ``Examples`` subdirectory. Check the source files for information about what the various examples does.

Reporting bugs
--------------

We track our bugs using the issue tracker at github. 
If you find a bug, please search to see if someone else
has reported it here:

  https://github.com/rartino/httk/issues

If you cannot find it already reported, please click the 'new issue' 
button and report the bug.

---------------------------------
Citing *httk* in scientific works
---------------------------------

This is presently the preferred citation to the httk framework itself:

   The High-Throughput Toolkit (httk), R. Armiento et al., http://httk.openmaterialsdb.se/.

Since *httk* can call upon many other pieces of software quite
transparently, it may not be initially obvious what other software
should be cited. Unless configured otherwise, *httk* prints out a list
of citations when the program ends. You should take note of those
citations and include them in your publications if relevant.
